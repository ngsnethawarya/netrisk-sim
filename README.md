# netrisk-sim

netrisk-sim is a small Python project created to explore how basic network risk
can be estimated using weighted scoring models.

The project simulates hosts with different exposed services and applies
configurable risk weights to produce a simple risk ranking.

This tool is intended for learning and experimentation, not production use.

## Project Goals
- Practice structured Python design
- Apply basic risk assessment logic
- Separate data, scoring, and evaluation logic

## Status
Initial development.
