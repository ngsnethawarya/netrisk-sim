# netrisk-sim

netrisk-sim is a simple Python-based simulation tool that models how risk
can differ across hosts in a network based on exposed services and basic
configuration factors.

This project focuses on risk-based thinking rather than exploitation.
It demonstrates how decisions such as open ports, service exposure, and
configuration choices can increase attack surface before any active
threat is present.

The purpose of this repository is to practice defensive analysis and
develop intuition around how network design influences security risk,
using a lightweight and transparent simulation approach.
